# Fake News Detection

This project is a fake news detection system that uses machine learning to classify news articles as real or fake. The system is built using Python and the scikit-learn library.

## Libraries 

The following libraries are required to run this project:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* nltk 
* numpy
* re

You can install these libraries using pip:

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of news articles labeled as real or fake. The dataset is available in the file `train.csv`.

## Model

The model used for this project is a logistic regression model. The model is trained on the dataset and can be used to predict the label of new news articles.

## Usage

To use the system, you can run the code in the notebook `fake_news_detection.ipynb`. The code will load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the training data and 97% on the test data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect fake news. The system can be used to help people identify fake news articles and make informed decisions.
